This project is for creating a generative AI-powered HR chatbot for the CBA office contest 

AILA is a AI driven Leave assistant which can do below assistance.

1. Understand Leave Policies: Offer comprehensive explanations of the organizationâ€™s leave policies, including types of leaves available (e.g., annual leave, sick leave, parental leave), accrual rates, and eligibility criteria.

2. Track Available Leaves: Display the current leave balance, including a breakdown of leave types, ensuring employees are always informed about their leave status.

3. Automated Leave Application: Allow employees to apply for leaves seamlessly through natural language commands, without the need to log into the Workday/HCM application. The AI assistant will interface with the underlying HR systems to submit leave requests automatically, enhancing user experience and reducing administrative overhead.

4. Other HR-related tasks: retrieve leave balance, draw summary of individual span/size by various levels.
